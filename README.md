## 3. General description <br>

JIJ is a website for booking in Jericho city with three expected locations for the tourist: hotels, hostel and the chalet. JIJ leads them to tourist attractions, and helps the tourists with several services they need.
### 3.1 Problem Statement:
We want to provide a tourist reference in Jericho, in particular, by reserving a place for temporary residence, without defects, and to keep the tourist informed of the updates of his request. <br>
Today we have a large number of cases of failure to book and not cover all overnight places in the city that lead to cases of financial injustice and commercial monopoly of the distinct places and ignore the rest of the places and attractions. <br> 
If we ignore this problem, Resources will need to increase to deal with successive problems, and we may miss customer trips that could lead to revenue loss, business loss, and more damage to our local reputation. <br>
